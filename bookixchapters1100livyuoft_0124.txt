intercessio or right of vetoing public measures that they
considered unjust to the plebeiansj and for this purpose
they sat at the door of the senate-house, and watched
without taking part in the proceedings. In viii. 13
they use their right of veto for their own protection,
but withdraw it. Their persons were sacred and
inviolable3 and they might not leave the city. [How
they had been with the army on this occasion is not
known 3 nor are they mentioned in v. 4. Possibly they
had been elected before the surrender, and did not
come into office till after3 otherwise, we must suppose,
they had guaranteed the treaty at Rome. Cicero merely
says (in De Offie. iii. 30) that they were surrendered
because the peace had been made by their authority.
If, as is suggested, this points to a ratification of the
treaty at Rome, they deserved to be surrendered for
assuming (or letting the οοηιῐίία tributa assume) the
powers of the comitia centuriata. Were it not for Cicero’s
statement, the scene of viii. 13, δια, would have looked
more like a piece de the'citre composed by Livy.]

By the efforts of their tribunes and the exercise of the
veto, the plebeians gradually won their way to the state
offices hitherto confined to the patricianS. In viii. 13,
Livy mentions two, L. Livius and Q. Maelius. Cicero
names Q. Maelius and T. Numicius as the tribunes of
this year. There were at first two tribunes, afterwards
five ; there were ten at the time of the Gracchi (133 B. cs).
The ‘tribunician power,' afterwards conferred on the
emperor, was one of the most important of the powers
that made up their absolutism.

Triumphus. After an important victory the general, by
decree of the senate, entered the city with his soldiers
in triumphal procession, carrying the spoil, and various
emblems of the victories (such as representations of the
towns taken), and the prisonem, and went to the
Capitol to offer thanksgiving to Jupiter. At the same
moment the chief prisoner was flung into the Tullianum
dungeon and left to perish, or was strangled. It was
customary sor a man dressed as Death to accompany
the general, and remind him of his mortality: moreover.
the soldier-s abused their commander with every form
of ribaldry.
