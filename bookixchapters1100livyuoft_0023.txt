TO THE BEGINNING OF LIVY IX 7

gari-ison into Palaeopolis‚ and the Romans laid
siege to the place.

326 B. o. Rome gave good terms to Campanian
Greeks, and Palaeopolis surrendered.

325—322. Samnium was overrun and penetrated
by Roman armies; and being decidedly worsted
the Samnites humbly sued for peace⁷ sending back
Roman prisoners and property taken in the war.
Their general, Brutulus Papius, the chief of their
war-party, slew himself to avoid being given up,
and his countrymen sent his dead body and goods
to Rome. But the Romans haughtily rejected their
offers and sent bac-k all but their own belongings,
and prepared to renew the war. Upon which the
Samnites, inspired by their new general, C. Pontius,
began to take energetic measures for sels-defence.

Such is the position of affairs at the beginning
of 321 B. c.‚ the year at which Lixy's ninth book
starts.
