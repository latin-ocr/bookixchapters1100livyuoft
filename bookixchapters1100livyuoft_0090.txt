72 · NOTES To LIVY

probably technically right, and by their religion absolved;
in practical politics they were right also if, as Mommsen
says, great nations‚ mindful of their destiny, may repudiate
treaties when they can. At any rate, they do Ξ

We should not judge the Numantine Convention (13.0. 145)
in the same way3 for the enemies' ignorance of Roman
ways would make much difference between the Numantine
and Caudine Conventions. (This very day one of our own
judges has denied a civil servant's right to a pension, on
the ground that officers who promised it had no power
to make the promise.)

alia, ‘in generaL’ or ‘besides‘

ξ 2. foedere. Cicero calls it a ‘foedus' Livy says a
‘foedus' could be made only with fetials and due rites as
described in ξ 3; some suppose it could be made without
the fetials. The reliyio of the matter depends on this point.

§ 3. per quem, &o All this depends on precatione (cf. the
ut clause in iii. ΙΙ). The order is: ut, quemadmodum . . . feriatur,
ita I uppiter feriat eum populum per quem fiat quominus . . . stetur.

per quem fiat quominus, &Q Translate, ‘whose fault it

ξ 4. ubi = ‘whereas’

praeterquam . . . non. Understand nomina: ‘ no names
but those of the two fetials.’

ξ 5. foederis dilationem, the delay in getting the treaty
ratified by the people.

ξ 6. exercitu, dative.

quorum . . . essent. Apart from the dependence of this
clause, or the ut clause, the subjunctive is due to the implied
words of the men 3 (so virtually oblique].

ᾗ 7. locorum. Needed in Latin to define more precisely,
but not in English. Cf. vi. 2, mdiynitas rerum.

non exploratorem. The defeat at Trasimene was due to
the neglect of the same elementary military rule.

ξ 8. intueri3 contemplari . . . proponere. Historic in·
finitives for indicative. Note the nom. subject.

mox tradenda, ‘that must soon be surrendered? (This,
especially with the neighbourhood of futuras, comes very
near a fut. pass, participle, as it was used in later Latin.
Cf. Ovid, Fast. i. 10, saepe tibi pater est, saepe leyendus avus,
‘often your father’s name, often your grandsire's, you are
sure to read herein.')

ξ 9. sociorum. The Capuans especially.

ξ 10. sine vulnere, &c.‚ inconsistent with iv. 1.

ξ 11. hora. fatalis, ‘the fated hour of their degradatum,
