OL'TLINE OF SAMNITE HISTORY

TO THE

BEGINNING OF LIVY IX.

THE Samnites, with the Picentines Vestini,
Frentani, Paeligni, and Marsi, belonged to the
Umbro-Sabellian stock; and migrating at an early
date these tribes occupied the east and south-centre
of the Italian peninsula, the Samnites taking the
mountainous districts in the south„ ’

From 450 to 350 13.c.· they gradually advanced
southwards to the Greek cities of Tarentum and
Thurii and westwards to Campania, and became
mixed with the Greeks; so that there arose differ-
enoes of culture and manners, and subsequently
quarrels between the old Samnites of the hills and
the Samnites of the Campanian plains and Lucania.

In 343 B.c. the Sidicini of Teanum and the
Campanians of Capua appealed to Rome for
protection against the Samnites of the hills3
and the Campanians putting themselves under
the supremacy of Rome, the Romans warned the
Samnites to respect the territory of a friendly
power; and after a campaign, the events of which
are [mem-tain, Capua was left to the Romans and
Teanum to the Sanmites.
