Lictor. An attendant granted to a magistrate. The dictator
had twenty-four, the consul twelve, the praetor (at
first two, then} six, They bore the fasces before
the magistrates, cleared the way, executed their
sentences, &a

Magister equitum. Originally the commander of the
cavalry. When a dictator was appointed by the comitia,
he perhaps nominated and the assembly (vii. 13)
appointed, a ‘magrister equitum, as chief of his staff and
his deputy, and especially commander of the cavalry.

Paludamentum. A military cloak, especially the general's
(v. 13).

Patres. (1) Heads of (patrician) households, and so the
senators. Patres conscripti =‘the fathers and the elect,'‘
i. e. men specially nominated to act as senators in
addition to the ⁶ fathers.’

(2) Patres also means the patricians. ,

Pilum. The Roman javelin used for hui-ling (xiii. 2)
(see Gladius), and probably for meeting cavalry-charges
and for camp-defence.

Plebs. Originally perhaps resident aliens at Rome, and
therefore excluded from office and civil rights; but
having civil duties they gradually (498-351 Rc.) secured
equality with the patricians, and became fully a part
of the populus.

Populus Romanus Quiritium. This is taken by some as an
error for P. R. et Quirites, a trace of the Roman and
Sabine union at Rome ; others as meaning ‘the Roman
people consisting of burgesses.' ‘ Quirites’ meant
spearmen, warriors, then burgesses.

Praetor. A magistrate (first created in 366 13.c.) that
presided at judicial inquiries. There were two: the
praetor urbanus, for citizens 0n1y3 and the praetor pere—
9rinus, for foreigners. (In later times there were more;
e. g. after Sulla there were twelve, for different courts.)
In case of necessity, a praetor took command of
an army.

The Praenestim praetor was possibly the chief magistrate
of Praeneste, or at least the commander of the contin-
gent from that Latin town (xvi. 17).

Praetorium. The two magistrates elected on the fall of the
kings (afterwards known as consuls), were at first
called praetores. So the consul’s quarters were known
as the praetorium, and his guards and flagship were
valled praetoriam, and these names remained.
