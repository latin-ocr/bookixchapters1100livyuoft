varietatibusque, ‘and by adorning my work with varied
patterns to procure both charming digressions for my

fuerit. Cf. vi. 13 and XV. 5.

§ 3. virtus, ‘excellenee,’ ·m01·ale.'

fortuna.. Cicero makes a great deal of a general’s good
luck in discussing the merits of Pompeius. Our own

quent'3 so perhaps here, ‘mention frequently! ‘are fond
of glorifying.’

vertenti, intransitive. Cf. revertissent in vi. 10.

ξ 7. recenseam. It would be better to read this, ‘Let me
pass in revieW‚’ than with the question, ‘Shall Ι pass in
review‘?’

nec, ‘not indeed!

aetatium. Cf. necessitatium in viii. 4.

§ 8. n’. Notiee this for Manius. Plain M. is for Marcus.
