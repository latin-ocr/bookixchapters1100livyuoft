CHAPTER ΙΙΙ

§ 1. pro ingenio, ‘according to his character.

[alius] per adversa.. This second alius is best left out,
as Muretus proposed.

adversa. montium, lit. ⁶ the obstacles of the mountains,’
i. e. ‘the opposing mountains.’ Cf. strata viarum, ‘the paved
ways'; opaca locorum, ‘dark places!

§2- vincimus. The usual tense, with iam, iamdudum, of
action, still continuing:

Eng. We have conquered [and are still conquering] l
Lat. [Vicimus et: vincimus
cf. xviii. 9.

ᾗ 3. sua.. Cf. sua obice in ii. 10.

moliri, ‘ upheave! The word is used of efforts of all kinds.

ξ 4. invicem. Adjectival (from Greek influence), cf. i. 3.
Translate, ‘in this interchange of talk?

xii. 8. See Personification in Grammar Appendix.

ne . . . quidem, ‘not even the Samnites,' i.e. in spite of
their victory.

§ 5. vis animi consiliique, ‘his spirit and judgement.'

ξ 6. quam primum. See on ii. ξ 1.

ξ 7. quae ubi. Notice the Latin idiom of double relative.

ξ 8. discordia.. Adj„ from discors.

in primis, ‘among the first,' i. e. ‘as much as any one
else,' or ‘more than any one else?

ipsum. = ‘ [his father) in person.’

§9- ita.. . . ferme ut, lit. ‘almost in such a way as to
change nothing,' i. e. ‘much to the same effect without
changing.'

ξ 10. firmare and differre. The future put as a present
fact: cf. Caesar, B. G. ii. 32, quae imperarent-m·facere dixerunt,
‘ they declared they were carrying out his orders!

quibus. Translate, ·’ by which time the Roman state would
only with difficulty recover its strength after the loss of
two armies.’

§11. quid, si. The apodosis is easily supplied, ‘what
would be the result, if? (So in xviii. 5, Quid, si vini amor
fieret acrior? ‘what would have been the result, if,’ Suc.)

ut. This clause depends on consilii, ‘namely that' ; just
as an ut clause would follow a verb of advising. Cf. V. 3,
vu. 12.
