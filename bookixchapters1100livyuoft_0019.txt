LIVY AND HIS WORK 3

there are conflicting accounts, he takes what best
suits his purpose, or even a piece of both, without
attempting to sift the evidence or harmonize dis-

ridicule, but in this matter he is only rightly
relating the truly Roman scrupulousness in such

at the close of the fourth century A. D.: in fact,
some lines from the letters of that belated pagan,
Symmachus, read like an extract from Livy.

was written shortly after the civil wars from tlte

reference in ch. xix: and from the mention of
