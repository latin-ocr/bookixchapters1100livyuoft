war, heard appeals of citizens from ⁸ capital ’ sentences.
The division of the people into centuries was originally
a military organization.

Consul. After the expulsion of the kings, the people elected
two consuls yearly as supreme magistrates. They were
nominally independent of control, but actually much
under the infiuence of the senate. In later times they
entered on their office on January 1, but not always
so in earlier times, as we see in viii. Ι, and even during
the Hannibalan war. When both were together at
Rome they presided in the senate in monthly turns,
as in viii. 23 they controlled the city, summoned the
comitia (xviii. 143, nominated dictator (vii. 12), com-
manded the armies (v. 6, δῖα).

Dictator. Nominated by the consuls (vii. 13} ; also known
as mayister populi ; appointed by the people with sovereign
power at critical times 101 six months, superseding all
the magistrates. The dictatorship was a temporary
return to monarchy.

Equites, Originally the cavalry, three hundred being
attached to each legion (cf. v. 5), i. e. three centuries
out of the eighteen centuries of equites. Gradually,
being the wealthiest class, the equites passed into the
‚equestrian order, ranking next to the senators; and
from the time of the Gracchi (133 Rc.) they began
to have judicial functions.

Fasces. A bundle of rods and an axe borne before dictators‚
consuls, and praetors, as symbols of their authority
(viii. 2 and vi. 6).

Fetialis. Among the many sacred colleges at Rome was
that of the fetials, whose special duty it was to see that
all proper formalities were taken when peace was made,
war declared, satisfaction demanded. The acting fetial
on such an occasion was known as the pater patratus.
(x. 8, 93 viii. 63 v. 1—4.) The college was composed of
men of the highest rank, e. g. A. Cornelius Arvina had
been dictator. The kindred tribes of Italy seem to have
had the same system.

Forum. An open place in the city, especially the Forum
Romanum, which lay between the Capitoline and Pala·
tine hilis, and was surrounded by shops (vii. 8), and
was the general place of business, public and private.

Gladius. The short sword of the Roman infantry. Instead
of bullet and bayonet, they used the pilum and sword :
