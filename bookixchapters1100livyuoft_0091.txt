ξ 2. si . . . offendisset, lit. ‘supposing their looks, too
fierce at the indignity, had offended the conqueror-'3 i. e.

imitates from Greek : cf. xix. 8, quacumque opus esset.

indignitas rerum. Cf. v. 7, dux locorum.

ξ 3. traducti, ‘paraded‚’ as in a public show, such as a
criminal being led to death.

ita. . . . agmen, ‘to them, as they looked upon their columns
in such degradation.'

omni. We should say ‘any.'

ξ 4. cum . . . possent, ‘when they might have! i. e. ‘though
they might have’ ; (concessive subj.).

xv. 5, and a similar one in xv. 7. We should say ‘ at Capua?

,δ 7. hospitalibus may be a subst. = ‘hospitality,’ or au
adj. with officiis.

§ 8. neque. Translate, ‘nay, but for all that? The nega-
tive is really not wanted, and is pleonastic.

non modo . . . sed ne quidem poterant. We say ‘not only
not . . . but not even.’ In Latin, if the predicate or other
word is common to both clauses, the second nonis usually
omitted.

§9.‘ super maerorem, with pudor: ‘ a sense of shame 111
addition to grief.’

ξ 10. cum-clause has no apodosis, but the cum-clause is
started again at vii. 1.

a. capua. Note the preposition. The use of preps. sor
clearer definition increased as the original sense of cases
was forgotten, until all, or nearly all, distinction of case
was lost in the Romance languages. Cf. xiii. 9.

proficiscentes is accusative, agreeing with Romanos under-1
stood.

revertissent, intransitive. Cf. verto, xvii. 6.
