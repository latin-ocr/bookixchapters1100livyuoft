6 OUTLINE OF SAMNITE HISTORY

341-328 B. c. While Rome was completing her
conquests of the Campanians and Volscians, and
quelling the Latin rebellion, the Samnites remained
inactive, partly from hostilities with the Italian
Greeks, and partly from want of a sound policy.
For Alexander the Molossian ( or king of Epirus
as Livy calls him) had been invited by the Taren-
tines and Lucanian exiles to assist them against
the Lucanians and Samnites. The latter were
defeated. Then Alexander and the Tarentines
quarrelled, and Alexander was murdered by
a Lucanian3 and the Greek cities of Italy again
became isolated, and the Samnites once more free
to look to Campanian affairs.

327 B. c. Second Samnite War. Allies of both.
At the beginning of the second war the Samnites
had to stand almost alone to sta-y the ever-increasing
power of Rome. Their only sure allies were
their kindred the Vestini, Frentani, Picentes, and
Paeligni. The Tarentines were too negligent
and too occupied, and the Lucanians were detached
by Rome and pitted against their natural enemies
the TarentineS.

The Etruscans would probably side with the
Samnites if they saw a chance of success ; (and they
did later on ; also the Gauls).

Whereas Rome was united and strong with her
late conquests, and could also depend on the
Apulians, who hated the Samnites; and, as we have
seen, pitted the Lucanians against the Tarentines.

Cause of War. The aggressions of Rome on
the Liris, and foundation of Fregellae in 328, and
the natural hostility of two strong nations.

Campanian conquests, had designs on Palaeopolis
and Neapolis <Naples). The Samnites threw a
